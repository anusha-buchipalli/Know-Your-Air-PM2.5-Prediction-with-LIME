# Know-Your-Air-PM2.5-Prediction-with-LIME
"Transparent AI models for interpretable forecasting of PM2.5 air pollution using explainable machine learning techniques."
This project leverages interpretable machine learning techniques to forecast PM2.5 air pollution levels and provides clear, actionable insights via model explainability. Using LIME, we highlight how input features influence predictions, creating transparency for researchers, developers, and decision makers.
## Features

- Robust data import supporting both image and tabular air quality datasets  
- Comprehensive data exploration including statistical summaries and visualization  
- Advanced data cleaning and preprocessing techniques, including missing value handling and normalization  
- Feature engineering to extract meaningful variables and enhance model input  
- Support for multiple machine learning models such as Random Forest and XGBoost for PM2.5 prediction  
- Thorough model evaluation using key metrics (RMSE, MAE, \(R^2\)) to ensure accuracy  
- Leveraging LIME for local explanation of model predictions, enhancing interpretability  
- Detailed visualization of model outputs and explanation results for easy understanding
