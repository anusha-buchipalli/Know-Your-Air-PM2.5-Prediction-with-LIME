# Know-Your-Air-PM2.5-Prediction-with-LIME
"Transparent AI models for interpretable forecasting of PM2.5 air pollution using explainable machine learning techniques."
This project leverages interpretable machine learning techniques to forecast PM2.5 air pollution levels and provides clear, actionable insights via model explainability. Using LIME, we highlight how input features influence predictions, creating transparency for researchers, developers, and decision makers.
